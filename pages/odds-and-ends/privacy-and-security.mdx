# Privacy and security

### Protecting your account

Buttondown offers multi-factor authentication (often referred to as MFA) to protect your account against
common threats such as phishing, brute force attacks, and password theft that may be made by malicious actors.

If you're not familiar with MFA, you can read [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)
to learn more about it. At a high level, it means adding an additional piece of evidence when logging in to prove who
you say you are. (Ever had to type in a six-digit code sent to your phone after putting in your username and password? That's
MFA!)

To register an authentication token and enroll your account in MFA, [head over to your Account page](https://buttondown.email/account) and scroll
down to the bottom of the page; you should see a table called **Multi-factor authentication tokens**:

Please note that at this time, Buttondown only supports third-party authenticator apps such as [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) and not
physical security keys or SMS. (If you feel strongly about this, please feel free to [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email).)

### Why Buttondown requires Javascript on archive pages

No interesting reason, just technical debt! This is something I hope to improve
in the future.

### GDPR compliance

Buttondown is of course fully GDPR compliant. You can read Buttondown's privacy policy [here](https://buttondown.email/legal/privacy) and its cookie policy [here](https://buttondown.email/legal/cookies).

If you're interested in a full data request, please [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email).

### Bug bounty

Sadly, Buttondown doesn't have the security budget to offer a bug bounty, _but_ I would be deeply indebted to you for doing so! Please report any vulnerabilities to [justin@buttondown.email](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) — I promise to respond promptly and provide a fix as soon as humanly possible.

Sincere kudos to the following individuals for reporting vulnerabilities:

1. John Bullecer
2. Vivek Modi
3. Filippo Valsorda
4. Iheanyi Ekechukwu
5. Beckett Normington

### Turning off link or click tracking

By default, link and click tracking is turned off on Buttondown.

If you'd like to enable these pieces of functionality, you can go to your [newsletter settings page](https://buttondown.email/settings) and scroll down to "Tracking & analytics":

### Adult content policy

My default stance is to support all content so long as it is not harassing, damaging, or otherwise illegal.

However, _paid newsletters_ are a bit of a different story. Buttondown uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses) to process payments; Stripe has some restrictions on adult content. Specifically, it prohibits:

> Pornography and other obscene materials (including literature, imagery and other media) depicting nudity or explicitly sexual acts; sites offering any sexually-related services such as prostitution, escorts, pay-per view, adult live chat features; sexually oriented items (e.g., adult toys); adult video stores and sexually oriented massage parlors; gentleman's clubs, topless bars, and strip clubs; sexually oriented dating services

Unfortunately, that means things are out of my hands: if you want to send adult content over Buttondown you cannot use its paid subscriptions functionality.

### Does Buttondown offer stipends or financial assistance to writers?

No. In the event that I _started_ such a practice, I would publish information about what heuristic I used as well as a full list of writers receiving such assistance.

But I will almost certainly never do this. It is a violation of Buttondown's core ethos, which is that Buttondown is a tool rather than an ecosystem — a piece of software, rather than a platform. It's important to me that people using Buttondown are, at the end of the day, writing _newsletters_, not _Buttondowns_.

## WCAG compliance

Buttondown follows the [compliance checklist as outlined by HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/web/section-508/accessibility-checklists/index.html).

If you have any other specific questions regarding Buttondown's accessibility, I'd be happy to answer — and if there are any specific accessibility gaps that you identify
in Buttondown, please let me know! I'd be happy to prioritize a fix.
